  1 Dependent Child - £18600+£3800/12 = £1866.67
  2 Dependent Children - £18600+£3800+£2400/12 = £2066.67
  3 Dependent Children - £18600+£3800+(£2400*2)/12 = £2266.67
  4 Dependent Children - £18600+£3800+(£2400*3)/12 = £2466.67
  5 Dependent Children - £18600+£3800+(£2400*4)/12 = £2666.67
  7 Dependent Children - £18600+£3800+(£2400*6)/12 = £3066.67
