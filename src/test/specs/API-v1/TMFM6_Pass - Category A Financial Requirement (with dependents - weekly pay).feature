Feature: Pass - Category A Financial Requirement (with Dependants - weekly pay)

		Requirement to meet Category A
			Applicant or Sponsor has received 26 payments from the same employer over 182 day period prior to the Application Raised Date

		Financial income regulation to pass this Feature File
			Income required amount no dependant child = £18600 (£1550 per month or above for EACH of the previous 6 months from the Application Raised Date)
			Additional funds for 1 dependant child = £3800 on top of employment threshold
			Additional funds for EVERY subsequent dependant child = £2400 on top of employment threshold per child

		Financial income calculation to pass this Feature File
			Income required amount + 1 dependant amount + (Additional dependant amount * number of dependants)/52 weeks in the year = 26 Weekly Gross Income payments => threshold in the 182 day period prior to the Application Raised Date

			1 Dependant child - £18600+£3800/52 = £430.77
			2 Dependant children - £18600+£3800+£2400/12 = £476.92
			3 Dependant children - £18600+£3800+(£2400*2)/12 = £523.08
			5 Dependant children - £18600+£3800+(£2400*4)/12 = £615.38
			7 Dependant children - £18600+£3800+(£2400*6)/12 = £707.69
